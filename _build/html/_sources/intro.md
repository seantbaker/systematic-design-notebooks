# Systematic design of analog ICs with Python and Jupyter

This (currently quite simple) site is setup to demonstrate how we can use
free, open source tools to design analog circuits in a simple, systematic
way.

This is based off of the book, "Systematic design of Analog CMOS Circuits"
by Paul G.A. Jespers and Boris Murmann.

Each page will walk through one of the examples in the book. Instead
of using Matlab functions as shown in the book, we'll be using a handful
of off-the-shelf Python packages along with some helper functions I made to
simplify some of the code.

For now I've got the examples covering the design of basic intrinsic gain
stages complete, and I'm hoping to make my way to the differential amplifier
examples in the next two weeks or so.

If you see any bugs, or have an suggestions, please stop by the Discussions
section of the GitHub repository behind this page.

Cheers!
